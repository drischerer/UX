# What is the purpose of your UX portfolio?
-member: donâ€™t rely on your CV for this. According to statistics, recruiters only spend 6 seconds looking at your CV. They will scan four key areas: your name, current position, previous position, and education

# What should you put in your UX portfolio?
- For each project, I expect to see:
- The problem
- Who you worked with
- What tools you used
- Discovery phases (how did you go about solving the problem)
- The process you used to overcome the problem: lo-hi wireframes, prototypes, sketches, personas, user journeys, and research
- The final outcome (both of your work, and what happened after it was handed over, e.g. to a UI designer or developer!)
